				<h2>General</h2>

				<h4>How does this work?</h4>
				<p class="serif">Your project should fit into one or more of our <a href="../../about/index.html">interest areas</a>, in alignment with the principles of the <a href="http://www.mozilla.org/about/manifesto.html">Mozilla Manifesto</a> and with the traits most important for the open Web. Admissions are rolling &mdash; we read, review, and accept applications on an ongoing basis.</p>
				<p class="serif">When your project is accepted for the WebFWD program, you'll be invited to participate in weekly project calls and LearnFWD sessions. You'll gain access to the WebFWD community hub on Yammer, and you'll have the opportunity to request the mentors you'd like to work with. Together, we'll establish a project roadmap for the duration of your Fellowship. More details can be found <a href="../../about/program/index.html">here</a>.</p>

				<h4>Can I apply from anywhere in the world?</h4>
				<p class="serif">Yes. Every aspect of our program is inherently global and decentralized, and we actively encourage applications from all parts of the world.</p>

				<h4>Why do you do this?</h4>
				<p class="serif">We love working with people like you, who care about the future of the Web and keeping it open and focused on the public good. Here are some key things we'd like to accomplish with WebFWD:</p>
				<ul class="serif">
					<li>Spur innovation & develop solutions in our <a href="../../about/index.html">predefined problem spaces/areas of focus</a></li>
					<li>Support you to build solutions with the traits that are important for the open Web</li>
					<li>Extend Mozilla's effectiveness and relevance in the world through support of outside innovation</li>
				</ul>

				<h4>Who's behind this program?</h4>
				<p class="serif"><a href="http://www.mozilla.org/">Mozilla</a>. You probably know us best as the maker of the <a href="http://firefox.com">Firefox</a> Web browser. Mozilla is a global non-profit dedicated to putting users back in control of their online lives, and shaping the future of the Web for the public good. When you use Firefox, you're supporting that mission and making the Web better for everyone!</p>
				<p class="serif">WebFWD came out of <a href="http://mozillalabs.com">Mozilla Labs</a>, that part of the Mozilla organization where we explore and tinker at the boundaries of what's possible today on the Web.</p>

				<h4>How much control do I give up by joining your program?</h4>
				<p class="serif">Nothing. Nada. Nichts. Did we mention that "we're different"? We want to help you build something with the potential to change the world. And we're sure you'll remember us when you find that pot of gold at the end of the rainbow. Because that's what we would do for you. But other than that - nothing, really.</p>
				<p class="serif">We want you to bring your idea into the Mozilla community, we want to learn from you (at least as much as you learn from us), we want you to write Open Source code and we want you to build an awesome product. That's all.</p>

				<h4>Can we turn our idea into a business?</h4>
				<p class="serif">Sure. And we're happy to help as much as we can. In particular <a href="../../about/team/index.html">Pascal</a> is interested in developing new business models for Open Source companies and popularizing them - as he believes that there is a lot of innovation to be done in this area.</p>

				<h4>This sounds (insert your term of excitement here)! What's the catch?</h4>
				<p class="serif">None. Seriously. And if you still don't believe us - <a href="../../other/contact/index.html">email us</a> or stop in at one of our monthly Bay Area CoffeeFWD or Office Hours meetups. We're also attending a bunch of events where you can meet with us.</p>

				<h2>Application Process</h2>

				<h4>Do I need a prototype?</h4>
				<p class="serif">Yes. And no. You don't need a finished, full-fledged prototype. But you need more than just an idea or a napkin sketch. You need code, mockups, something tangible you can demo. Most of all: you need to be able to pull this off and ship your product or service.</p>

				<h4>What are you looking for in a founding team?</h4>
				<p class="serif">Mainly, you should have the ability to deliver on what you set out to do. This often means a great combination of core skills. If your team is missing key skills it's not a deal-breaker, but it surely will be much harder.</p>

				<h4>Do you only take teams?</h4>
				<p class="serif">Not necessarily. But it is certainly easier to build a product if you're not a lone soldier but come as a group of people with strong core skills.</p>

				<h4>Can I apply if I'm not a US citizen and/or live in the US?</h4>
				<p class="serif">Yes. WebFWD Fellows can be anywhere in the world - we deliver all the benefits of the program over the Web, phone, Skype, etc. If you are close to one of our offices around the world you are more than welcome to hang out there - but you don't have to.</p>

				<h4>Is the program localized for my country?</h4>
				<p class="serif">At this time, our teams are global and we conduct the program (as well as ask for project submissions) in English.</p>

				<h4>Am I too young or too old to be a WebFWD Fellow?</h4>
				<p class="serif">As long as you fulfill the legal requirements for starting a business (i.e. you are at least 18 years old) we are golden. If you have a great project idea and you're under 18 years old, you may be eligible to be a Friend of WebFWD.</p>

				<h4>Do I need to move to be part of the Fellow program?</h4>
				<p class="serif">No. Fellows can be located anywhere in the world. We deliver mentorship sessions and workshops via video conferencing, use mailing lists and online tools to keep in touch, and we'll check in with you regularly via phone or Skype.</p>

				<h4>Do I need to work on this full-time?</h4>
				<p class="serif">You don't have to quit your day job, but you probably won't benefit from the program unless you have enough time to build, ship, and iterate.</p>

				<h4>What is the selection process?</h4>
				<p class="serif">Our selection committee evaluates applications based on their fit with our interest areas, overall alignment with the traits we care about and (obviously) the potential of idea and team. We might ask you to join us for follow-up calls/video conferences or in-person meetings if we have questions about your project.</p>

				<h4>Why didn't you choose me?</h4>
				<p class="serif">Don't fret. Us not choosing you is by no means a statement about your skills or your idea. You or your project might not be a good fit for the program at this time, but this is by no means a reflection on your skills or the quality of your idea. WebFWD is a young program and for now we've decided to narrow our focus on a few, rather specific areas which fit deeply into Mozilla's current focus.</p>

				<h4>What's the deadline for my application?</h4>
				<p class="serif">There is no deadline. We have a rolling submission process and accept projects at pretty much any time.</p>

				<h4>Do I need a business plan (and what is this anyway)?</h4>
				<p class="serif">No, we don't require a business plan. And if you don't know what this is - no worries. We'll figure it out together.</p>

				<h4>We are already incorporated (a company) - can we still apply?</h4>
				<p class="serif">Yes, that's not a deal-breaker. As long as you're willing to comply with our requirements.</p>

				<h2>The Program</h2>

				<h4>Who are your mentors & experts?</h4>
				<p class="serif">Here is <a href="../../about/mentors/index.html">a complete list</a>. All our mentors are amazing experts in their respective fields. And a lot of fun to hang out with.</p>

				<h4>What is a typical mentoring session?</h4>
				<p class="serif">Typically a mentor spends some time with all teams in a (usually highly interactive) presentation, then goes on to sit down with individual teams to answer questions, provide insights, give direction, etc. Often mentors hang around for a drink or two in the evening.</p>

				<h4>What else do you provide? Office space, infrastructure, ramen?</h4>
				<p class="serif">Basically, we help you with all the stuff you need to get your project off the ground. We can help you with servers, software, UI, UX, design, marketing, legal advice... the list goes on and on.</p>

				<h4>What about networking (not the cable-type but the meat-space type)?</h4>
				<p class="serif">Plenty of networking opportunities. The power of networking can't be overestimated. More often than not it's the people you know who will help get your idea out into the world, or tell you to forget about it. So we make sure you meet lots of the right people. And if networking is something which doesn't come naturally for you - we'll help.</p>

				<h4>What happens in the Fellows program?</h4>
				<p class="serif">First and foremost - you will build your product. In the process, you will meet other Mozillians, exchange ideas, get critiqued, learn and present. We run regular workshops on topics such as application/infrastructure scalability & security, project management, marketing, community engagement and lean-startup methodology. We'll match you with awesome mentors who will help you build your product and answer questions. And you will become part of the WebFWD community, giving you many opportunities to mingle, network and learn from each other.</p>

				<h2>Other</h2>

				<h4>What do you exactly mean when you say my technology must be Open Source?</h4>
				<p class="serif">Simple: All the code you write during the program (and as a prerequisite the code you base your work on during the program) needs to be released under a <a href="http://mpl.mozilla.org/scope/tri-license-and-the-gpl/">tri-license (MPL, GPL and LGPL)</a> or similarly open license. This is exactly the same way Mozilla releases software, including our Firefox browser.</p>

				<h4>What if my project turns out to be a dud?</h4>
				<p class="serif">No worries. Such is life (sometimes). The world will not end.</p>

				<h4>Are you looking for more mentors and other people & organizations to help WebFWD?</h4>
				<p class="serif">Yes. Please send us an email or check out the apply links in the footer.</p>

				<h4>Are you hiring?</h4>
				<p class="serif">Mozilla is hiring. Check out our <a href="http://www.mozilla.org/en-US/about/careers.html">open job listings</a>.</p>
