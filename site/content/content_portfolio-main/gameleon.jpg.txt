Info: Gameleon is a web platform that enables users to create, publish and play HMTL5 games using only a browser! It doesnâ€™t require any programming skills on the user's behalf. For all intents and purposes, we're Wordpress for Game Creators.
We are providing a browser-based cloud editor where games may be developed and assets (skins, maps, scripts, etc.) may be traded in the integrated marketplace.
In a nutshell, we're helping developers create games fast, easy, from everywhere, in a collaborative fashion. They can also monetize via premium services or licensing on the marketplace
