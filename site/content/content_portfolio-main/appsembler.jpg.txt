Info: Appsembler's mission is to elevate the open source ecosystem and make open source software more accessible. Our curated marketplace of ready-to-run open source web apps makes it easier for non-technical people to find, try and buy apps. Developers and vendors can register apps, set a monthly price and earn money by selling subscriptions on their own website using our 1-click try-before-you-buy widget. Appsembler takes care of the hosting, billing and other promotional services, in exchange for a cut of the monthly recurring revenue.
