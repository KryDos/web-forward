Info: Sketchfab is a web service to publish interactive 3D content online in real-time without plugin. We live in a 3D world, but the web is still in 2D, and we want to change that. We think 3D models deserve something better than screenshots or videos to be shown. That's why we created Sketchfab. We understand 3D and bring it to the web.
