Info: Knights of Ni, we are but simple travelers who seek the enchanter who lives beyond these woods. Well, what do you want? You can't expect to wield supreme power just 'cause some watery tart threw a sword at you! We shall say 'Ni' again to you, if you do not appease us. Found them? In Mercia?! The coconut's tropical!
