Name: Open Jumpstarts
----
Info: OpenJumpstarts is an open and free marketplace for one-click web applications. Developers who build web apps and even Wordpress Themes or Drupal-based sites want other developers and users to try out their applications, but face a high barrier to entry from requirements to set up a local server, database, configurations, etc. Now with OpenJumpstarts, developers can turn their web apps into Jumpstarts; they receive a â€œTry it now" button to place on their website allowing any visitor to launch their app in under 30 seconds.
