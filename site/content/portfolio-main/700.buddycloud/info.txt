info: buddycloud is group communication done right. Create a channel and invite your friends in to share and discuss photos, videos and text about any subjects . Your channels can be shared with the world - or can be made private. Like email, a buddycloud channel is federated: anyone can run a buddycloud server and all buddycloud instances will find each other. Simple. And your data stays secure. buddycloud takes the best of social networking and applies it to group communication so that people are more productive.
