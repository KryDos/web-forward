		<p class="largeP">Mozilla is an open source success story – a not-for-profit organization with talented volunteer contributors and staff around the world. It’s no wonder that gifted entrepreneurs and technology innovators often approach us for help with their own ideas.</p>
		<p class="largeP">In years past, we’ve extended ad hoc support. We believed that by taking a more programmatic approach, we could extend our ability to foster innovation and support others who share our vision of an open and accessible Web. WebFWD was born in the summer of 2011 with two teams and a vision for sustaining open source startups via coaching and access to technical and professional resources.</p>
		<p class="largeP">During our first 8 months we grew to <a href="@root_path/portfolio/">14 teams</a> with members in 5 countries. We built a significant library of <a href="@root_path/about/resources/">resources</a> and roster of world-class <a href="@root_path/about/partners/">partners</a>. As the program grew, we came to believe that teams would benefit even more from an intensive curriculum, supported by coached, focussed development and culminating in a graduation event.</p>
		<p class="largeP">In June 2012, we fine-tuned the program, developing an aggressive 8-week curriculum of teaching and deliverables supported by expert office hours. These sessions are followed by 4 focused weeks of building, accompanied by mentorship and office hours as needed. At graduation time, we evaluate funding for qualifying projects as a way to continue our support beyond the 12-week program.</p>
